Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.


## File: 0-main.c
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

Based on the  file above, create a file named  This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, [if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.](https://github.com/Lordwill1/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

## File: 1-main.c
- Donâ€™t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
- You do not have to compile with  for this task.
- 

## File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h
This program prints the largest of three integers.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- Line count will not be checked for this task.

## File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
### NOTE: FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE ON SAMPLE 2, YOU NEED KNOWLEDGE OF LOGIC TRUTH TABLE.

* Code sample 1


* Code sample 2 (You need knowledge on logic truth table)



* Code sample 3 (This is the code we are to work on)



### Fix the  function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

* Line count will not be checked for this task.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).


# AS A PROGRAMMER, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK?
- To help you track down that bug, start reading your code aloud. 
- Pretend that a programmer friend is sitting right next to you. 
- Explain what your code is doing and how it works. As you talk through your code, youâ€™ll find the problem. If you donâ€™t, have your imaginary friend ask you questions during your explanation.
- Donâ€™t worry about going mental. Youâ€™re a C programmer. Youâ€™re already mental. ðŸ˜…


As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
